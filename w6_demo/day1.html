        //declaring variables- use keyword def; var must be declared before they can be assigned
        var num     //declaration only

        //assignment - assigning/storing data to variable (friendly name)
        num = 7 //assignment only

        //declare & assign at once
        var num1 = 10
        var num2 = 7

        //once variablea have data assigned, they can be used in output/input/processing/conditions
        //mathmatical pocessing
        var sum = num1 + num2 //order importance reads from top to bottom
        //with assaignment, everything to the right of the equal sign is processed first! storage occurs from the result of the right into the left
        console.log(sum) 

        //output -- display of infro fom the program to a user/human

        //output for testing -developers only
        console.log('Hello World!')
        console.log(num1) //value only
        //we can also mix messages & stored value by using literal strings
        //'${var}' will replace with stored value
        console.log(`the sum of ${num1} + ${num2} = ${sum}`)

        //output for user - displayed to browser page 
        //alert() creates pop up; further lines will not be read until user interacts with ok button
        alert(`Hello World`)

        console.log(`alert exited`)

        alert(`the sum of ${num1} + ${num2} = ${sum}`)

        //input - gaining data from a user (or somewhere else :D) into the program code
        //when asking a user for input, we need to use it some way, so we store the result to a variable
        var name = prompt(`enter your name: `)
        console.log(name)

        var last = prompt(`enter you last name: `)
